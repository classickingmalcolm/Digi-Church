				<p>One can never consent to creep when one feels an impulse to soar.–Helen Keller. Motivational Quote #7:“Some men give up their designs when they have almost reached the goal; while others, on the contrary, obtain a victory by exerting, at the last moment, more vigorous efforts than before.”–Polybius. Motivational Quote #8:“A wise man will make more opportunities than he finds.”–Francis Bacon.</p>
				<p>“I do not have superior intelligence or faultless looks.  I do not captivate a room or run a mile under six minutes.  I only succeeded because I was still working after everyone else went to sleep.”–Greg Evans. Motivational Quote #2: “Give me a stock clerk with a goal, and I will give you a man who will make history. Give me a man without a goal, and I will give you a stock clerk.”–J.C. Penny..</p>
				<p>The fishing is best where the fewest go, and the collective insecurity of the world makes it easy for people to hit home runs while everyone else is aiming for base hits. There is just less competition for bigger goals.  If you are insecure, guess what? The rest of the world is, too. Do not overestimate the competition and underestimate yourself. You are better than you think.”–Timothy Ferriss</p>

				<p>The world has the habit of making room for the man whose actions show that he knows where he is going.”–Napoleon Hill. Motivational Quote #4:“If you think you can do it, or you think you can’t do it, you are right.”– Henry Ford</p>
				<p>he truth of the matter is that there’s nothing you can’t accomplish if: You clearly decide what it is that you’re absolutely committed to achieving. You’re willing to take massive action.

There is just less competition for bigger goals.  If you are insecure, guess what? The rest of the world is, too. Do not overestimate the competition and underestimate yourself.
