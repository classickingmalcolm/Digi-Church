				<h3>Special Recovery Made</h3>
				<p>he truth of the matter is that there’s nothing you can’t accomplish if: You clearly decide what it is that you’re absolutely committed to achieving. You’re willing to take massive action. The fishing is best where the fewest go, and the collective insecurity of the world makes it easy for people to hit home runs while everyone else is aiming for base hits. There is just less competition for bigger goals.  If you are insecure, guess what? The rest of the world is, too. Do not overestimate the competition and underestimate yourself. You are better than you think.”–Timothy Ferriss.  The world has the habit of making room for the man whose actions show that he knows where he is going.”–Napoleon Hill.
